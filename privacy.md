security of your personal information. 
This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your data while
using our app.

#### Data Collection

We want to assure you that we do **NOT** track or store any sensitive data of
the user. 
Our app does **NOT** access your phone's private storage, including contacts,
media, mailboxes, passwords, or any other confidential information.

#### Optional Email Address

We may **optionally** ask for your email address, solely for the purpose of
providing you with the ability to back up and recover your watched movies log. 
Your email address will only be used for this specific functionality and will
**NOT** be shared, sold, or used for any other purpose without your explicit
consent.

#### Usage of Data

The data you provide, such as your optional email address, is used strictly for
the purposes of enhancing your experience with the app, including backup and
recovery functionality. 
We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to any third
parties.

#### Cookies and Advertisements

At MovyonTv, we want to emphasize our commitment to a transparent and
advertisement-free user experience within the boundaries of our app.
Therefore, we would like to inform you that our app does **NOT** use cookies or
any form of advertisement within its interface.

We believe in respecting your privacy and ensuring a seamless, uninterrupted
interaction with our app. 
This means you can enjoy exploring movie schedules and utilizing our features
without being subjected to tracking mechanisms or intrusive ads within the app.

However, please be aware that our app contains a link to IMDb. When users click
on this link and are redirected to the browser, it is important to note that
external websites, including IMDb, may use cookies and display advertisements.
These practices are beyond our control and occur outside of our app's
environment.

Rest assured that your usage data remains solely within the app for the purposes
outlined in our Privacy Policy.
We are dedicated to providing you with a privacy-focused, enjoyable movie guide
experience without compromising your data or inundating you with advertisements.

#### Data Security

We take data security seriously. 
We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data from
unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
Despite our best efforts, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us.

#### Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with
personal information, please contact us, and we will promptly delete such
information from our records.

It's important to note that our app contains movie trailers that may include
content such as violence, mild language, and thematic elements.
While we take measures to ensure that sensitive content is appropriately
labeled, we strongly recommend that parents and guardians preview the content to
determine its suitability for their children.

#### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be posted within the app, and we encourage you to review the
Privacy Policy periodically.
